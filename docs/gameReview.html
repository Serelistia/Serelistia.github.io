      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Path of Kami (DEMO) is a charming 3D puzzle platformer game set in a spirit world inspired by Japanese culture and folklore. You play as Kazeyo, the spirit of a wolf, and are guided by Wisp, a guardian spirit. In the DEMO version, your main goal is to obtain three spirit keys in order to continue on your journey through the spirit world.

      <h3>The Spirit World</h3>

		  <img src="images/artstyle.png" alt="Kazeyo sits on a snowy cliff, overlooking trees and mountains in the distance." />
          <p>I want to begin by acknowledging the beautiful artstyle of this game. The Wisp is a cute little orb-like spirit that floats around Kazeyo as you wander throughout the world. Kazeyo's fur has elegant, flowing lines that glow a lovely shade of sky blue. </p>
		  <p>The terrain and models are rather simplistic up close, but that may be an artistic choice. The snow coating the ground is a simple blanket of white, and the rocks are mostly plain chunks of varying shades of gray, depending on the rock and lighting. The tree trunks are a plain brown, but have a surprising amount of detail in the leaves -- although the leaves of the pine trees are a bit inaccurate; they're rather rotund for leaves that should have been more needle-like.</p>
		  <p>The real draw of the artstyle is in the distance -- a stunning blur effect is overlaid on top of the environment, making it feel as if you are looking at a stained glass artpiece. I often found myself simply pausing to admire the landscape laid out before me. If you love games with a memorable artstyle and well-made world, this game is for you.</p>

		  <h4>Evergreen Sea</h4>
          <img src="images/tutorial01.png" alt="Kazeyo stands in front of an unlit Spirit Lantern, with platforms in the ground nearby." />
          <p>As you travel around the Evergreen Sea, the starting area for the game, you eventually come across a Spirit Lantern.</p>
		  <p>When you first approach it, Wisp tells you that you can ignite the lantern using your Spirit Fire, and the corresponding button for that action is shown in a little cloud on the top right corner of the dialogue box. The default button for a mouse is left click; for an Xbox controller, it is the X button. Using this skill makes Kazeyo let out a little bark.</p>
		  <img src="images/tutorial02.png" alt="Kazeyo stands in front of a lit Spirit Lantern, the nearby platform now raised like stairs." />
		  <p>Lighting up this lantern will then elevate the nearby platforms, allowing you to continue on your journey.</p>
		  <img src="images/spiritFire.png" alt="Kazeyo stands in front of a colorful floating flame." />
		  <p>Down by the diverging river, you can find a colorful floating flame that replenishes your Spirit Fire. It emits a sound akin to a wind instrument, gently humming like the breeze. The conveniently-placed flame is in the midst of your first puzzle -- you must ignite three Spirit Lanterns.</p>
		  <p>As the introductory puzzle of the game, this one is quite easy. All three Spirit Lanterns are in plain sight, and your biggest hurdle is possibly falling into the water if you are a bit too careless. Falling into the water will teleport you back to the nearest checkpoint, which in this case is the nearby cliff, just past the first spirit lantern tutorial.</p>
		  <p>Each time you light a Spirit Lantern, you hear a noise in the direction of where the puzzle reward will spawn.</p>
		  <img src="images/collectible01.png" alt="Kazeyo stands next to a lit Spirit Lantern, with a green trinket floating in front." />
		  <p>Once all three Spirit Lanterns have been lit, you can add the first item to your collection: a Magatama Bead. It emits a rather jarring sound -- dissonant whispers, unable to be understood, but very much present in your ears. The Magatama Bead serves no discernable purpose in the DEMO version, but may have more significance in the full game. For now, it is a shiny little trinket that we can add to our magical inventory of item-holding.</p>
		  <img src="images/tutorial03.png" alt="Kazeyo stands in front of a lit Spirit Lantern, the nearby platform now raised like stairs." />
		  <p>Now that the first puzzle is complete, we can move on to the next section of the game. But first, another tutorial! This time, Wisp tells you that you can take Spirit Fire back from lit Spirit Lanterns, and just like before, the corresponding button is shown in a little cloud on the top right corner of the dialogue box. The default button for a mouse is right click; for an Xbox controller, it is the X button.</p>

        <div class="card">
		  <h4>Yokoro Village</h4>
          <img src="images/tutorial04.png" alt="Wisp tells Kazeyo to investigate a nearby Sacred Fountain." />
		  <p>As you enter the village for the first time, Wisp suddenly drags the camera away to focus on a Sacred Fountain in the vicinity, telling you to come investigate it. The Sacred Fountains function as checkpoints in this game. They fully replenish your Spirit Fire, and you will respawn in the water of the last visited Sacred Fountain if you fall into water nearby.</p>
		  <img src="images/bell01.png" alt="Kazeyo stands near a floating bell." />
		  <p>Back to where Kazeyo was before the sudden dialogue pop-up, there is a floating bell just a few steps ahead. It emits a rather faint low-pitched chime-like noise, barely audible over the music. The bell appears to be slightly larger than Kazeyo's head.</p>
		  <img src="images/bellYoink.png" alt="Kazeyo holds the previously-floating bell in their mouth." />
		  <p>Collecting the bell makes it magically shrink to fit in Kazeyo's mouth, which is the only real way for a wolf to pick things up. Kazeyo looks incredibly adorable with the bell, and it also muffles any sound that Kazeyo vocalizes.</p>
		  <img src="images/bellPlaced01.png" alt="Kazeyo stands next to the bell, now in its rightful place." />
		  <p>The bell once again magically changes its size, this time growing much larger than Kazeyo's entire body, as it moves to its proper place: hanging from the ceiling, with a log to the side meant for tolling the bell.</p>
		  <img src="images/bellToll.png" alt="Kazeyo stands next to the log used to toll the bell." />
		  <p>If you stand around here, close to the log, you can use your interaction button -- the same one used to light Spirit Lanterns -- to toll the bell. As far as I have discovered, doing this serves no real purpose in the DEMO, other than to toll the bell. It may have more significance in the full game.</p>
		  <img src="images/collectible02.png" alt="Kazeyo stands near a floating tea kettle, with a lit Spirit Lantern nearby." />
		  <p>Now, the puzzle for this region is just a tad bit more challenging than in the Evergreen Sea. One of the Spirit Lanterns is in plain sight -- you immediately see it when Wisp first whisks your camera away to look at the Sacred Fountain. The other two lanterns are located somewhere in the village, and one is mostly obscured by a house towards the edge.</p>
		  <p>Once all three Spirit Lanterns have been lit, a Kettle will appear near the Sacred Fountain, next to the nearby Spirit Lantern. Another shiny thing to add to your shiny things collection!</p>
		  <img src="images/lanternRafts.png" alt="Kazeyo stands on the shore of an island, lighting the mini Spirit Lanterns on mini rafts." />
		  <p>Past a small bout of platforming across the river, you can find five small rafts on the shores of an island. These mini-rafts each have Spirit Lanterns that can be lit with Spirit Fire.</p>
		  <p>In the real world, this is part of a festival called <em>Toro Nagashi</em>, "floating lanterns", where mini-rafts carrying lit lanterns are set afloat on rivers to commemorate the souls of the dead.</p>
		  <img src="images/spiritKey01.png" alt="Kazeyo sits a good distance away from the first spirit key obtainable in the game." />
		  <p>Hopping back to Yokoro Village mainland, you can find your first Spirit Key of the game. As the first Spirit Key, it is incredibly easy to find -- it is floating right next to the pedestal that it needs to be placed onto. Once that's done, the nearby gates will open, and you can then move on to the next region.
