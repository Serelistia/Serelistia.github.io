      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Path of Kami (DEMO) is a charming 3D puzzle platformer game set in a spirit world inspired by Japanese culture and folklore. You play as Kazeyo, the spirit of a wolf, and are guided by Wisp, a guardian spirit. In the DEMO version, your main goal is to obtain three spirit keys in order to continue on your journey through the spirit world.

      <h3>The Spirit World</h3>

          <p>I want to begin by acknowledging the beautiful artstyle of this game. The Wisp is a cute little orb-like spirit that floats around Kazeyo as you wander throughout the world. Kazeyo's fur has elegant, flowing lines that glow a lovely shade of sky blue. </p>
		  <p>The terrain and models are rather simplistic up close, but that may be an artistic choice. The snow coating the ground is a simple blanket of white, and the rocks are mostly plain chunks of varying shades of gray, depending on the rock and lighting. The tree trunks are a plain brown, but have a surprising amount of detail in the leaves -- although the leaves of the pine trees are a bit inaccurate; they're rather rotund for leaves that should have been more needle-like.</p>
		  <p>The real draw of the artstyle is in the distance -- a stunning blur effect is overlaid on top of the environment, making it feel as if you are looking at a stained glass artpiece. I often found myself simply pausing to admire the landscape laid out before me. If you love games with a memorable artstyle and well-made world, this game is for you.</p>

          <p>As you travel around the Evergreen Sea, the starting area for the game, you eventually come across a Spirit Lantern.</p>
		  <p>When you first approach it, Wisp tells you that you can ignite the lantern using your Spirit Fire, and the corresponding button for that action is shown in a little cloud on the top right corner of the dialogue box. The default button for a mouse is left click; for an Xbox controller, it is the X button.</p>
		  <img src="images/tutorial02.png" alt="Kazeyo stands in front of a lit Spirit Lantern, the nearby platform now raised like stairs." />
		  <p>Lighting up this lantern will then elevate the nearby platforms, allowing you to continue on your journey.</p>
		  <img src="images/spiritFire.png" alt="Kazeyo stands in front of a colorful floating flame." />
		  <p>Down by the diverging river, you can find a colorful floating flame that replenishes your Spirit Fire. The conveniently-placed flame is in the midst of your first puzzle -- you must ignite three Spirit Lanterns.</p>
		  <p>As the introductory puzzle of the game, this one is quite easy. All three Spirit Lanterns are in plain sight, and your biggest hurdle is possibly falling into the water if you are a bit too careless. Falling into the water will teleport you back to the nearest checkpoint, which in this case is the nearby cliff, just past the first spirit lantern tutorial.</p>
		  <img src="images/collectible01.png" alt="Kazeyo stands next to a lit Spirit Lantern, with a green trinket floating in front." />
		  <p>Once all three Spirit Lanterns have been lit, you can add the first item to your collection: a Magatama Bead. It serves no discernable purpose in the DEMO version, but may have more significance in the full game. For now, it is a shiny little trinket that we can add to our magical inventory of item-holding.</p>
		  <img src="images/tutorial03.png" alt="Kazeyo stands in front of a lit Spirit Lantern, the nearby platform now raised like stairs." />
		  <p>Now that the first puzzle is complete, we can move on to the next section of the game. But first, another tutorial! This time, Wisp tells you that you can take Spirit Fire back from lit Spirit Lanterns, and just like before, the corresponding button is shown in a little cloud on the top right corner of the dialogue box. The default button for a mouse is right click; for an Xbox controller, it is the X button.</p>
