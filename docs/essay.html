            <p>The most significant challenges for a new learner would be understanding the syntax
                and coding principles of HTML and CSS, assuming that they have zero coding experience
                before starting the project.

                Another challenge that seems more common than I ever expected was managing files. I
                personally did not have issues with it, but I saw too many people struggle with their
                projects because they lost the file location or accidentally created two repositories
                or whatever else may arise from improper file management.

                Building a website from scratch using oXygen allowed for far greater control than
                using the PSU Sites builder, which uses WordPress. However, using the PSU Sites
                builder was much easier and quicker than manually coding the website, because it
                allowed the use of UI and had more simplified options.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For developing sites in either format, one needs patience (getting code to actually
                work is incredibly frustrating) and the ability to truly learn from one's mistakes.
                One must also be able to learn and understand the new coding languages that they are
                learning for making these websites, and be able to manage their files well.

                For improving my website, I think I want to learn more about good design philosophies,
                how to make my website more accessible, and color theory to create a more pleasing
                color palette. I like the current colors of my website, but I feel like it could
                definitely be improved.
